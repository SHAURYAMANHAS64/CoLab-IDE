# CoLab-IDE
This project proposes an AI-Powered Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor, a cloud-based development environment where multiple users can collaborate through chat while an integrated AI assistant generates executable code in real time. The generated code runs directly inside the browser using WebContainers, eliminating the need for local setup.
